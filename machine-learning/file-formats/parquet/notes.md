# Apache Parquet

OSS Column-oriented file format for efficient storage and retrieval.

Column-based retrieval is less expensive than row-based.

Much faster retrieval, lesser size and lower cost than CSV for big data.

CSV better for ordered data retrieval. Parquet better for sums/aggregations/etc.

Better compression than CSV due to being Column-based.

### Example

```Parquet
# NOT ACTUAL DATA BUT EXAMPLE
1 2 3
n1 n2 n3
20 35 62
```
