# Protobuf (Protocol Buffers)

OSS structured data serialisation mechanism. Useful as serialisation format
for structure data, and as wire format for network communication.

Developed by Google.

Supported by an RPC protocol stack called gRCP.

Thing with Protobuf is that it seems to generate actual code used to access
the file data, while AVRO is schema based and generates machine-readible JSON.
