# Key Management Service (KMS)

Service for storing and managing cryptographic keys that are used to encrypt data. KMS uses HSMs (Hardware Security Modules) - physical computing devices used to manage digital keys, and to perform the acutal encryption and digital signing.

Supports multi-Region replication (using the same key in multiple regions).
