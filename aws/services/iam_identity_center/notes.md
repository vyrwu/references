# AWS IAM Identity Center - successor to AWS Single-Sign On (SSO)

You create workforce identities (users/groups), or integrate with existing directory (Azure AD/Okta Universal Directory/Microsoft AD Domain Services).

Grant users access to SAML 2.0 applications. AWS applications like Amazon Managed Grafana/Amazon Monitron/Amazon SageMaker Studio Notebooks, discover and connect to IAM Identity Center to receive sign-in and user directory services. 

Designed to support multi-account architectures - configure common job titles and grant IAM permission based on those.
